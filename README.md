The Card Flip Game is a memory-based game where players need to match pairs of cards by flipping them over. The game consists of a grid of cards, initially face-down. When a player flips over two cards, if they are a match, they remain face-up. Otherwise, they flip back face-down, and the player continues flipping cards until all pairs are matched.
